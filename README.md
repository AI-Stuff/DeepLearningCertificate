# Earning the Latently Deep Learning Certificate

## Professional track

To gain access to our cluster of nVidia P100s running on Bitfusion Flex send your resume to dlc@latent.ly. We will set up a Google Hangout and work with you to pick a paper that is suitable for your skill level. 

You can also simply fork the LDLC and implement a paper that we don't yet have an implementation of, or significantly optimize or substantially refactor and improve an existing implementation. Most existing code uses Tensorflow, but other frameworks are acceptable as well. 

A couple of rules: Before pull requests can be merged and a certificate issued, code must pass code review and you must sign a contributor agreement. You may use your own computing resources to write code, but please don't write code at work or school unless they are willing to assign all rights to the code to you. When writing code *do not* look at other existing implementations, otherwise the author of those implementations may own your code.

## Research track

More advanced candidates may use our our hardware and mentorship resources to conduct original research and to publish it. 

For those who are more business oriented we will work with you to design a novel deep learning architecture using state-of-the-art methods on our GPU cluster.

For those who are more academically oriented you may use our resources on the Comet and Stampede supercomputer (currently #20 in the world) to publish a model built using either [*emergent*](http://grey.colorado.edu/emergent), NEURON, Genesis3, Moose, NEST, PyNN, Brian or Freesurfer. At this time we can only provide mentorship for *emergent*. Note that research done on The Neuroscience Gateway must advance the state of the art in computational neuroscience, computational cognitive neuroscience, cognitive computational neuroscience or a related field. The code will be licensed under the GPLv2 and will not be sold on our marketplace.
