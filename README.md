## Latently Deep Learning Certificate - Publicly Replicate all AI and ML Scientific Papers and Patents

Welcome to the LDLC!

Have you ever felt that the progress in deep learning was so dizzyingly fast that you couldn't keep up? That technology was passing you by? That there's no way for you to get qualified for that industry job in AI/ML/DL simply because you didn't have access to hardware? That you aren't sure whether it's safe to create a business using a particular algorithm due to patent concerns? 

Worry no more! The LDLC is here to help!

In partnership with Bitfusion, IBM and The Neuroscience Gateway, Latently is offering a certificate program that is poised to simultaneously solve these problems and more. We are creating a community of engineers who are simultaneously leveling up the skills they need to get work and stay caught up with the latest advances while also contributing to the world's largest repository of implementations of optimization algorithms.

The certificate program has two tracks. The first is the professional track, where participants will replicate or implement a hot or historically important scientific paper on our GPU cluster running the Bitfusion Flex platform. The code will be made available to the public under the GPLv3, and to Latently with an unrestricted license. Your code may eventually be made available for sale on our marketplace and you will retain the majority stake. The second is the academic track, where participants will implement a model using the ['''emergent''](https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent) deep learning simulator on the Comet and Stampede supercomputers. This code will only be licensed under the GPLv3.

In addition to hardware resources we also provide access to expert mentorship and a community of peers (https://latently.slack.com).

No one will be turned away, however, for the professional track you will need to do a quick interview where we gauge your skill level and help you pick a paper (and sign some paperwork) and optionally pay for our placement services. For the academic track we recommend setting up a meeting with us but it's not required to get started - you can simply [follow these instructions](https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Stampede) to get access to our supercomputing resources.

## Guidelines

* Code must be written in Tensorflow or a library that uses it such as Keras or Sonnet.
* Code should be factored out into a resuable library that makes it simpler to implement new papers. 
* If existing implementations of a paper exist, **you must not look at them**. All code must be implemented with a cleanroom mentality. This is important for legal reasons.
* Code should either be written on your personal computer or on Latently's GPU cluster. Do not write code for this project at work or at school.
* Code is subject to code review. Commits should be small and frequent.
* Repositories for specific papers should be named as follows: Author1Author2Author3EtAl1996_1. In other words, the last name of the first three authors followed by EtAl if there are more than three and followed by the year. If more than one paper has that code then add an underscore and increment a counter that starts at 1.
* Dependencies are discouraged.
* You may not depend on libraries with viral licenses.
